# YB's Apprenticeship Portfolio (May - November 2022)
I have completed a 6 month apprenticeship at a PropTech start-up where I was able to apply my newly acquired skills/knowledge from a Business Intelligence and Data Analyst Program by Temasek Polytechnic and learned what is needed to scale in the analytics space. 

As an Analytics Engineer apprentice, my core responsibility was to understand data needs and gather requirements from cross-functional teams in order to develop data-driven capabilities. Leveraging on my previous work experience in stakeholder management, I actively engaged business users and stakeholders, translating their business requirements into data requirements. It allowed me to better propose the dashboard and data story flow.

I also owned the end-to-end development cycle where I performed data wrangling such as:
- Understand and piece several data sources together for analysis,
- Build readable, usable, and re-usable data models with clear lineage from raw, unstructured and messy data,
- Cleanse the data, identify gaps or empty data,
- Remove irrelevant or unnecessary data
 
to prototyping, building and implementing of dashboards/ Google Sheets. 

This apprenticeship has been an incredibly rewarding journey, especially with the opportunity to gain real-life experience and work alongside various business stakeholders. Not to forget keeping abreast with the evolving modern data stack adopted. 

To celebrate my first milestone in my mid career switch, I am creating this compilation to showcase some of the dashboards which I had created during my apprenticeship. I have also designed simple banners to complement the dashboards.

## Dashboard 1: Automating Analysis of Zoom Webinars featuring multiple projects 
As it was time-consuming to generate and download the webinar reports after every session to analyse the data, the process was automated by ingesting the data into multiple datasets and thereafter joined with internal user and CRM databases to do analytical querying.

Though the webinar report takes less than 5 minutes to download, it provides statistics in an excel sheet with no analysis. The marketing team was unable to gain any in-depth insights nor compare how each webinar was performing, how the outreach of their marketing campaigns were, whether the participants engaged our services thereafter, etc. With the dashboard, the team is able to see all in one glance.

Some of my thoughts for consideration when drawing up the data story flow: 
- Breakdown of participants - registered/non-registered participants, staff/non-staff, exclude panelists 
- Engagement level of these participants - did they enquire about the projects after the webinar?
- Conversion rate - did they register for our membership after the webinar?
- Detailed analysis of each webinar (provide a high level view)
- Performance of tracking links 



## Dashboard 2: Analysis of Referral Program 
As it was cumbersome for the managers to reference several data sources to assess the program's progress and even more tedious to do manual calculation to evaluate a referrer's performance daily, I have created an anaytical dashboard with in-depth insights. It provides the managers a high level overview of the program's overall health and allows them to engage the respective team members on their individual performances.

Dashboard users feedbacked that they no longer need to spend 15 minutes to login to several admin accounts to extract the statistics and another 30 minutes to run their analysis. With the dashboard, the managers are able to screenshot the daily insights to their team and for management reporting as well in less than 5 minutes.

Some of my thoughts for consideration when drawing up the data story flow: 
- Daily program statistics - provide breakdown of how each referrer is performing
- Overall program statistics - how to track success and recognise slumps 
- Top X performer chart - foster competitive spirit and keep track of who might need guidance 
- Conversion rate - overall and individual breakdown 
- Engagement level of the new members by the referrer 


## Dashboard 3: Analysis of Chatbot's data 
Two new features were launched in July and September consecutively and it was critical to track their performances and measure success. Prior to dashboard creation, it involved several sessions with the product manager and backend developers to understand the workflow, the business requirements before self-analysing how the two features can be merged into version two of the dashboard to provide a holistic overview and allow for performance comparison. 

With the dashboard, product managers no longer need to rely on backend developers to manually extract the overall and individual statistics nor manually count the number of successful conversion themselves. Neither do they need to login to the CRM database to track the progress of each conversion.

Some of my thoughts for consideration when drawing up the data story flow: 
- Overall statistics as well as individual feature statistics - allows for comparison
- Weekly overview of successful conversion - to track success and recognise slumps 
- Responses consolidated - to understand the current market situation 
- Cohort Analysis - to understand user's behavioural patterns
- Conversion Funnel - to understand the conversion of users into a successful lead and which part of the journey did they drop off 
- Sales tracking - Provide statistics of successful cases and overview of all cases 

## Google Sheet 4: Trend analysis of HDB Resale Flat Prices
Leveraging on publicly available data on transacted prices for HDB resale flats, I'd queried the data and provided analysis based on the user's requirements. The Google Sheet: 
- Tracks the average resale of HDB units based on HDB town, postal district and flat model
- Reflects the total transaction based on breakdown 
- Shows the percentage change in flat prices compared to the previous month
- Provides dynamic changes to cell when its value meets certain conditions
